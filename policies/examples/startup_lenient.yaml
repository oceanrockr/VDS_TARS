# T.A.R.S. SLA Policy Template: Startup (Lenient)
# Version: 1.0.0
# Phase: 15 - Post-GA Operations Enablement
#
# Description:
#   Lenient SLA policy for early-stage startups or new services in
#   development/beta. Lower thresholds allow teams to iterate quickly
#   while still tracking key metrics. Suitable for: MVPs, beta services,
#   experimental features, internal tools.
#
# Usage:
#   python -m analytics.run_org_sla_intelligence \
#       --org-report ./org-health-report.json \
#       --sla-policy ./policies/examples/startup_lenient.yaml

# Remediation guidance (focused on learning)
remediation:
  at_risk:
    - "Document the issue for future reference"
    - "Add to backlog for next sprint"
    - "Consider if this is expected for current stage"
  breach:
    - "Review if SLA targets are realistic for stage"
    - "Create ticket for remediation"
    - "No immediate escalation required"

# Graduation criteria
graduation:
  note: "Consider upgrading to default policy when service matures"
  criteria:
    - "Service has been stable for 30+ days"
    - "User base has grown beyond beta testers"
    - "Service is customer-facing"
    - "Revenue depends on service availability"
